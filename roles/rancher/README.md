NFS role Work flow:
    As needed add nfs host groups based on the site and role(dev/prod) and these variables are defined in the new master and new cjoc YML. Which will select the hostname for the delegation task execution during the cje/cjoc playbook execution. Based on the type(cje/cjoc) nfs folder structure will be created on the nfs server.
